      <h2>Dean's Opinions on Civil Servants</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        My father worked as a county agricultural agent for the
        University of Minnesota Extension Service for over two decades,
        a public job.  He enjoyed it, worked hard and conscientiously,
        and valued he work he and the organization could do for the
        people of the county.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked for the State of Minnesota for 16 years.
        I tried to be conscientious and am proud of much of the work
        I did there.  While there were inefficiencies, they were mostly
        related to management and bureaucracy than any corruption
        or lazyness.  Many of the inefficiences are probably common to
        any large, bureaucratic organization, even a private one.
        Almost everyone who I worked with, including the managers, worked
        hard and tried to do good work.  (The managers just reorganized
        things too many times or something.  I wasn't on that level.)
        Many people were serious about the mission of the organization
        and how it could serve the state.  Even those who were not were
        trying to do good work.  I can only think of one or two exceptions
        out of at least a hundred that I knew well enough to tell.
      </p>
      <h3>Opinions</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the vitriol against government services is deliberately
        manufactured and is out of proportion to any real shortcomings
        of the government.  This includes the Minnesota State Government
        and the U.S. Federal government.  The stereotype that most
        government employees just lean on shovels instead of working hard
        is offensive and wrong.  I am sure it happens.  Where it happens,
        it should be fixed.  However, I do not believe that is how most
        government employees or departments behave.  Furthermore,
        villifying public employees as a class is not only unfair, but
        will discourage talented, principled people from joining the
        government.  Our nation's (the United States') 2025 indiscriminate
        assault on our civil servants and on the civil service itself is
        an example of cutting off our nose to spite our face.  It may
        take well over a decade to recover, and that is assuming we stop.
      </p>
      <h4>Thank you</h4>
      <p>
        I cannot fix our society or change the current regime.  However,
        I can show appreciation.  I can say thank you.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;">
        Public employees, <b>thank you</b> for your service.
      </p>
      <h3>Buttons</h3>
      <p>
        Here are a couple of button designs I made in support of our
        civil servants and in opposition to those villifying them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="../images/ButtonElliptcal.png"
             alt="Oval button design saying Proud Civil Servant in white on a dark blue background surrounded by small white stars." />
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="../images/ButtonCircleHeart.png"
             alt="Circular button design saying I Heart Govt. Employees!" />
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="../images/ButtonSquareDoge.png"
             alt="Square button design saying Doge is Dodgy." />
      </p>
      <h4>InkScape SVG Source Files</h4>
      <p>
        Here are the InkScape SVG source files for the buttons just in case you
        want to modify them.  They require fonts from
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>.
        SVG is a text-based format, so to see which fonts you need, open the
        file in a text editor like Notepad and search for "font-family".
