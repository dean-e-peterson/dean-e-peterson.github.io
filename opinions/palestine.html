      <h2>Dean's Opinions on Palestine and Israel</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Note: I put Palestine first in the title not to give the
        Palestinian people preference over the Jewish people or the
        nation state of Israel.  I understand the word
        &ldquo;Palestine&rdquo; to mean either the entire area of land
        or the people group.  As such I think &ldquo;Palestine&rdquo;
        is the more general term.  For example, 500
        years ago, there was no nation state of Israel.  The land of
        Palestine was still there, whatever the identities of the
        inhabitants.</em>
      </p>
      <h3>April 3, 2024 Draft of Proposed Comments to My Senators and Congressperson</h3>
      <p>
        Like many Americans, I have watched as Israel suffered a brutal
        attack by Hamas on October 7 killing over 1,000 Israelis,
        and as Israel has mounted military operations in Gaza that
        have killed over 30,000 Palestinians and endangered millions
        more with famine.  I sit enjoying my chicken Caesar salad as
        Hamas keeps Israeli hostages, thankful that I and my cat have
        plenty to eat as children in Gaza starve.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why have I not written you about this before now?
        I have had a hard time knowing what to demand in the short term.
        A permanent ceasefire would save so many lives, but if Hamas
        survived intact, this could all happen again.
        I also realize that we that the US influence over Israel is not
        unlimited, and that we do not want
        to give Benjamin Netanyahu cover by letting him distract from his
        corruption and failures by claiming he is standing up for Israelis
        by standing up to US pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, we need to do what we can.  Here, then,
        are my requests:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prioritize GREATLY increasing aid to the Palestinians in Gaza.
          I do not care how, but they need much more aid, not just a
          little more.  I am not naive.  I know Hamas may siphon off some
          of the aid.  In the horrible calculus of war, that is regrettable
          but may be unavoidable.  I will be more blunt.  If it is a choice,
          I would rather a few more Hamas fighters survive and end up killing
          a few more Israeli troops, as horrible as that would be, than to
          let tens of thousands of Gazan children die, which is a very
          real possiblity.  Even if Gazans voted for Hamas 20 years ago,
          they do not have a functioning democracy now, and the Gazan
          children were not even alive then.  More aid.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Longer term, do not give Israel a pass on infringing the rights
          of Palestinians.  Yes, Israel must defend itself, but that does
          not give Israel carte blanche to dispossess and disenfranchise
          Palestinian civilians.  In particular, Israel should STOP
          building settlements in the West Bank (and not start building
          them in Gaza.)  Palestinians should have the democratic right
          of self-determination, whether that be as a separate nation in
          a two state solution or as full citizens in the state of Israel.
          Indefinate occupation and land grabs are not acceptable behavior.
          If we need to cut off military or other aid to Israel, so be it.
          Even if we need to cut off most aid, I would still support selling
          Israel ammunition for their iron dome to defend their civilians.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Why do I mention the Palestinian people and not the Israeli
        hostages?  Because I am confident that Israel is already doing
        everything they can (as they should) to get those hostages back,
        moving heaven and earth if necessary.  I doubt they need our help
        with that, but if they do, we should help them.  However, it is
        not OK to prioritize Israeli hostages over far greater numbers
        of Gazan civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do I take such a strong stance against Israeli settlements?
        Sure, settlements sound innocuous out of context, and I'm sure
        many wonderful things happen in Israeli settlements like families
        raising children.  However, the overall program is still an
        unjustified land grab.  For comparison, imagine if someone stole
        your house, then defended their actions by saying they are taking
        good care of it and are raising a lovely family there.  That does
        not give someone the right to steal your house, and it does not
        give Israel the right to build settlements on Palestinian land.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know some believe that all land within Israel's ancient borders
        belongs to Israel by historical or religious right.
        Historically, that could be argued of anyone who ever lived anywhere
        and still survives as a people group.  However, even religiously,
        such an argument is not defensible.  Even if you assume Biblical
        prophesy should have a place in US forgeign policy, and even if you
        assume Biblical
        prophesy cares so much about specific borders, Biblical prophesies
        do not come with due dates; the Bible says that God's time is
        not our time.  Therefore, even from a Biblical perspective, saying
        that the Israelis need to take over all of Palestine in this
        century or even in this millenium is adding a non-Biblical human
        due date to a Biblical prophecy, unilaterally assigning our
        generation to the task, and then treating that combination
        as God's Word even in DIRECT CONTRAVENTION of what the Bible
        unambiguously demands, that we love our neighbor.
        A devoutness that thinks God values borders more than people is not
        a devotion I feel bound to respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        To anticipate an argument against me, who am I to tell people what
        they can and cannot believe religiously?  No one special.  That is
        a valid point, although I find it interesting that anyone making it
        is avoiding the substance of my Biblical argument.  Ultimately,
        people can of course believe what they want to.  However,
        stop demanding that the US government
        (and, by extension, me) support and participate in your religious
        land grab at the expense of the livelyhood and human rights of
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        What about the long history of oppression against the Jewish people?
        What about Israel's survival and security?  To that I say:
        Israel already has enough land inside its pre-1967 borders to be
        a thriving nation state.  They do not need the West Bank and the
        Gaza strip to survive and thrive.  The only thing they still need
        is security from terrorism, something which should only be enhanced
        over the long term by improving relations with the Palestinians.
        After all, Israel has been trying variants of their current
        strategy for decades, and it has not guaranteed security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, Israel's needs and rights should not come at the
        expense of the needs and rights of the millions of Palestinians
        living in the West Bank and Gaza.  Palestinians should have the
        same freedom and self-determination as we want for ourselves and
        for the Israelis.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of final clarifications that I hope are not necessary,
        but I will make them explicit.   None of this means that I do not
        support the existence of Israel.  None of this means that I
        support Hamas.
