      <h2>Dean's Opinions on Palestine and Israel</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Note: I put Palestine first not to give the Palestinian people
        preference over the Jewish people or the nation state of Israel,
        but because by my understanding the word &ldquo;Palestine&rdquo;
        can refer to the entire area of land as well as to the people
        group, and as such is the more general term.  For example, 500
        years ago, there was no nation state of Israel.  The land of
        Palestine was still there, whatever the identities of the
        inhabitants.</em>
      </p>
      <h3>March 29, 2024 Draft of Proposed Comments to My Senators and Congressperson</h3>
      <p>
        Like many Americans, I have watched as Israel suffered a brutal
        attack by Hamas on October 7 killing over 1,000 Israelis,
        and as Israel has mounted military operations in Gaza that
        have killed over 30,000 Palestinians and endangered millions
        more with famine.  I sit enjoying my chicken Caesar salad as
        Hamas keeps Israeli hostages, thankful that I and my cat have
        plenty to eat as children in Gaza starve.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why have I not written you about this before now?
        I have had a hard time knowing what to demand in the short term.
        A permanent ceasefire would save so many lives, but if Hamas broke
        it, again, this could all happen again.  I also realize that we
        only have so much influence over Israel, and that we do not want
        to give Benjamin Netanyahu cover by letting him distract from his
        corruption and failures by claiming he is standing up for Israelis
        by standing up to foreign pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, we need to do what we can.  Here, then,
        are my requests:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prioritize GREATLY increasing aid to the Palestinians in Gaza.
          I do not care how, but they need much more aid, not just a
          little more.  I am not naive.  I know Hamas may siphon some
          of the aid.  I will be more blunt.  If it is a choice, I would
          rather a few more Hamas fighters survive and end up killing a
          few more Israeli troops, as horrible as that would be, than to
          let tens of thousands of Gazan children die, which is a very
          real possiblity.  Even if Gazans voted for Hamas 20 years ago,
          they do not have a functioning democracy now, and the Gazan
          children were not even alive then.  More aid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Longer term, do not give Israel a pass on infringing the rights
          of Palestinians.  Yes, Israel must defend itself, but that does
          not give Israel carte blanche to dispossess and disenfranchise
          Palestinian civilians.  In particular, Israel should STOP
          building settlements in the West Bank (and not start building
          them in Gaza.)  Palestinians should have the democratic right
          of self-determination, whether that be as a separate nation in
          a two state solution or as full citizens in the state of Israel.
          Indefinate occupation and land grabs are not acceptable behavior.
          If we need to cut off military or other aid to Israel, so be it.
          Even if we need to cut off most aid, I would still support selling
          Israel ammunition for their iron dome to defend their civilians.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Why do I mention Palestinian people and not Israeli hostages?
        It is not because I think the Israeli hostages are less important.
        It is because I am confident that Israel is already doing
        everything they can (as they should), moving heaven and earth
        to get those hostages back.  I doubt they need our help with
        that, but if they do, we should help them, but not at the expense
        of far greater numbers of Gazan civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do I take such a strong stance against Israeli settlements?
        Sure, settlements sound innocuous out of context, and I'm sure
        many wonderful things happen in Israeli settlements like families
        raising children.  However, the overall program is still an
        unjustified land grab.  For comparison, imagine if someone stole
        your house, then defended their actions by saying they are taking
        good care of it and are raising a lovely family there.  That does
        not give someone the right to steal your house, and it does not
        give Israel the right to build settlements on Palestinian land.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know some believe Israel has an historical or religious right
        to all land in their ancient borders.  Historically, that could
        be argued of anyone who ever lived anywhere.  Even religiously,
        such an argument is not defensible.  Even if you assume Biblical
        prophesy cares so much about specific borders, Biblical prophesies
        do not come with due dates, and the Bible says that God's time is
        not our time.  Saying that the Israelis need to take
        over all of Palestine in this century or even in this millenium is
        adding a non-Biblical due date to a Biblical prophecy, unilaterally
        assigning our generation to the task, then treating it as God's
        Word even in DIRECT CONTRAVENTION of what the Bible unambiguously
        demands, that we love our neighbor.  Israel has enough land inside
        its pre-1967 borders to be a thriving nation state without taking
        land the Palestinians still need to live on.  A devoutness that
        thinks God values borders more than people is not a devotion I
        feel bound to respect.  To anticipate a specious argument against
        me, who am I to tell people what they can and cannot believe
        religiously?  I am not.  People can believe that if they want to.
        What I am saying is to stop forcing me, via US tax dollars, to
        support and participate in your religious land grab at the expense
        of the livelyhood and human rights of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of final clarifications that I hope are not necessary,
        but I will make them explicit.   None of this means that I do not
        support the existence of Israel.  None of this means that I
        support Hamas.
