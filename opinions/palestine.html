      <h2>Dean's Opinions on Palestine and Israel</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Note: I put Palestine first in the title not to give the
        Palestinian people preference over the Jewish people or the
        nation state of Israel.  I understand the word
        &ldquo;Palestine&rdquo; to mean either the entire area of land
        or the people group.  As such I think &ldquo;Palestine&rdquo;
        is the more general term.  For example, 500
        years ago, there was no nation state of Israel.  The land of
        Palestine was still there, whatever the identities of the
        inhabitants.</em>
      </p>
      <h3>April 10, 2024 Draft of Proposed Comments to My Senators and Congressperson</h3>
      <p>
        Like many Americans, I have watched as Israel suffered a brutal
        attack by Hamas on October 7 killing over 1,000 Israelis,
        and as Israel has mounted military operations in Gaza that
        have killed over 30,000 Palestinians and endangered millions
        more with famine.  I sit enjoying my chicken Caesar salad as
        Hamas keeps Israeli hostages, thankful that I and my cat have
        plenty to eat as children in Gaza starve.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why have I not written you about this before now?
        I have had a hard time knowing what to demand in the short term.
        A permanent ceasefire would save so many lives, but if Hamas
        survived intact, this could all happen again.
        I also realize that the US influence over Israel is not
        unlimited, and that we do not want
        to give Benjamin Netanyahu cover by letting him distract from his
        corruption and failures by claiming he is standing up for Israelis
        by standing up to US pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, we need to do what we can.  Here, then,
        are my requests:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prioritize GREATLY increasing aid to the Palestinians in Gaza.
            I do not care how, but they need much more aid, not just a
            little more.  I am not naive.  I know Hamas may siphon off some
            of the aid.  In the horrible calculus of war, that is
            regrettable but may be unavoidable.  I will be more blunt.
            If it is a choice, I would rather a few more Hamas fighters
            survive and end up killing a few more Israeli troops, as
            horrible as that would be, than to let tens of thousands of
            Gazan children die, which is a very real possiblity.  Even if
            Gazans voted for Hamas 20 years ago, they do not have a
            functioning democracy now, and the Gazan children were not
            even alive then.  More aid.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If and when Israel goes into Rafah, demand that Israel enact
            plans to protect the majority of the civilian population, and
            to do a better job at protecting civilians than they have to
            this point in their military campaign.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Longer term, do not give Israel a pass on infringing the rights
            of Palestinians.  Yes, Israel must defend itself, but that does
            not give Israel carte blanche to dispossess and disenfranchise
            Palestinian civilians.  In particular, Israel should:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                STOP building settlements in the West Bank (and do not start
                building them in Gaza.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Take concrete steps toward giving Palestinians the democratic
                right to self-determination.  This could be as full citizens
                in the state of Israel or in a separate Palestinian state as
                part of a two state solution.  However, a single state
                solution must give Palenstinians the full franchise and vote,
                and a two state solution must really move forward, and not be
                forever delayed as the occupation continues.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In short, indefinite occupation and land grabs are not acceptable
        behavior.  At some point, the US must cut off military or other aid
        to Israel.  The US should not participate, even by proxy, in the
        indefinite occupation of the Palestinian people.
        Note that even if the US cuts off most aid, we could
        still sell Israel ammunition for their iron dome to help them
        defend their civilian population.
      </p>
      <h4>Anticipated Objections from Some Supporters of Israel</h4>
      <p>
        Why do I mention the Palestinian people and not the Israeli
        hostages?  Because I am confident that Israel is already doing
        everything they can (as they should) to get those hostages back,
        moving heaven and earth if necessary.  I doubt they need our help
        with that, but if they do, we should help them.  However, it is
        not OK to prioritize Israeli hostages over far greater numbers
        of Gazan civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do I take such a strong stance against Israeli settlements?
        Sure, settlements sound innocuous out of context, and I'm sure
        many wonderful things happen in Israeli settlements like families
        raising children.  However, the overall program is still an
        unjustified land grab.  For comparison, imagine if someone stole
        your house, then defended their actions by saying they are taking
        good care of it and are raising a lovely family there.  That does
        not give someone the right to steal your house, and it does not
        give Israel the right to build settlements on Palestinian land.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know some believe that all land within Israel's ancient borders
        belongs to Israel by historical or religious right.
        Historically, that could be argued of anyone who ever lived anywhere
        and still survives as a people group.  However, even religiously,
        such an argument is not defensible.  Even if you assume Biblical
        prophesy should have a place in US foreign policy, and even if you
        assume Biblical
        prophesy cares so much about specific borders, Biblical prophesies
        do not come with due dates, and the Bible says that God's time is
        not our time.  Therefore, even from a Biblical perspective, saying
        that the Israelis need to take over all of Palestine in this
        century or even in this millenium is adding a non-Biblical human
        due date to a Biblical prophecy, unilaterally assigning our
        generation to the task, and then treating that combination
        as God's Word even in DIRECT CONTRAVENTION of what the Bible
        unambiguously demands, that we love our neighbor.
        Perhaps there are things I am not aware of in the Jewish religion
        that argue for more immediate action, I do not know.  However, I
        still believe in the primacy of being good to your neighbor, and
        any devoutness that thinks God values borders more than people is
        not a devotion I feel particularly bound to respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        To anticipate an argument against me, who am I to tell people what
        they can and cannot believe religiously?  No one special.  That is
        a valid point, although I find it interesting that anyone making it
        is avoiding the substance of my Biblical argument.  Ultimately,
        people can of course believe what they want to.  However,
        stop demanding that the US government
        (and, by extension, me) support and participate in your religious
        land grab at the expense of the livelyhood and human rights of
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        What about the long history of oppression against the Jewish people?
        What about Israel's survival and security?  To that I say:
        Israel already has enough land inside its pre-1967 borders to be
        a thriving nation state.  They do not need the West Bank and the
        Gaza strip to survive and thrive.  The only thing they still need
        is security from terrorism, something which should only be enhanced
        over the long term by improving relations with the Palestinians.
        After all, Israel has been trying variants of their current
        strategy for decades, and it has not guaranteed security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, Israel's needs and rights should not come at the
        expense of the needs and rights of the millions of Palestinians
        living in the West Bank and Gaza.  Palestinians should have the
        same freedom and self-determination as we want for ourselves and
        for the Israelis.
      </p>
      <h4>Anticipated Objections from Supporters of the Palestinians</h4>
      <p>
        Given all of the above, why do I not demand more and sooner?
        Why do I not demand an immediate, permanent cease fire?
        Why do I not demand that the US immediately cut off all aid to
        Israel?  Why do I not demand that Israel immediately end its
        occupation?
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I still support Israel's existence, and I think there
        are legitimate security concerns over their hostages and over
        the continued existence of organized Hamas units.  Furthermore,
        I think the continued existence of Hamas also hurts the
        Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, to give people who know much more than I do the time and
        flexibility to work on things.  Perhaps I am naive, and perhaps
        I do have a Eurocentric, Israel-supporting bias based on where
        I come from culturally.  However, I think about the following:
        Would pressuring Israel with aid cutoff in 6 months bring
        about greater changes in Israeli policy than pressuring Israel
        right now?  I don't know, but it is possible, especially since
        right now Netanyahu might just dig in his heels.
        If Israel were to immediately withdraw from Gaza and the West
        Bank, would Hamas or other violent Iranian-supported groups
        take over?  Maybe?  I think it would be disasterous if it happened.
        Is the Palestinian Authority in its current incarnation capable
        of or supported enough by the Palestinian people to run a new
        palestinian state if the occupation were ended today?  I don't
        know, and I'd rather have experts and actual stakeholders work
        on these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are so many things I do not know, but there is one thing
        I am pretty sure of.  The Palestinian people will get one chance
        at this.  For example, consider a two state solution.  If the
        West Bank and the Gaza strip are freed, but are in such a
        disordered state that violent extremists take over and attack
        Israel?  It's over.  The Palestinian people, even ones not
        remotely involved in such an attack, would have no hope for a
        free homeland for a generation, if ever.
        I do not know the best way to move to free Jews and free
        Palestinians stably coexisting, but I know it won't be easy,
        and it won't necessarily be quick.  However, it needs to happen,
        and it cannot be infinitely delayed.
        Therefore, I have tried to demand things that give negotiators
        room to work, and to make my long term demands about directions,
        goals, and what features, like Palesinian self determination,
        that that I would accept in a solution.
      </p>
      <h4>Final Clarifications</h4>
      <p>
        A couple of final clarifications that I hope are not necessary,
        but I will make them explicit.  I support the existence of Israel.
        I do not support Hamas.
