      <h2>PowerShell Tip</h2>

      <h3>Enabling Scripting - Execution Policies</h3>
      <p>Help on execution policies (note the plural):</p>
      <code><kbd>help about_execution_policies</kbd></code>

      <p>Show execution policy that is in effect:</p>
      <code><kbd>Get-ExecutionPolicy</kbd></code>

      <p>
        Show execution policy at different scopes.  If it is Undefined
        in all scopes, Powershell defaults to <code>Restricted</code>
      </p>
      <code><kbd>Get-ExecutionPolicy -List</kbd></code>

      <p>
        Enable script execution except for unsigned, remote scripts by
        changing the machine-wide execution policy.  (Remote supposedly
        means from web, email, and sometimes UNC):
      </p>
      <code><kbd>Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</kbd></code>

      <p>
        Change machine-wide execution policy back to the default.  (You
        can also set execution policy to <code>Restricted</code>
        explicitly, but restoring it to <code>Undefined</code> is more
        like a new machine.  On a new machine, all scopes start out
        <code>Undefined</code>, which makes the effective execution
        policy <code>Restricted</code> by default anyway.  Play around
        with <code>Get-ExecutionPolicy, Get-Execution Policy -List, and
        Set-ExecutionPolicy</code> on a new machine to see the effects,
        or trust me.):
      </p>
      <code><kbd>Set-ExecutionPolicy Undefined</kbd></code>

      <p>
        If you don't trust the previous command to do what you want,
        this changes the machine-wide execution policy to Restricted
        explicitly, which is has basically the same effect as the
        previous command I believe.
      </p>
      <code><kbd>Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted</kbd></code>

      <p>Enable script execution just in this powershell process:</p>
      <code><kbd>Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process</kbd></code>

      <h2>Windows Event Log Tips</h2>

      <h3>Event Viewer GUI</h3>
      <p>
        Microsoft updated the Event Viewer GUI starting with Vista/2008.
        I like the <code>Ctrl+F</code> Find, although the filtering
        functionality could still use some work.
      </p>

      <h4>Find An Event with Ctrl+F</h4>
      <p>
        To find an event in the Event Viewer GUI, use
        <code>Ctrl+F</code> or the Find button.  (I'm embarrassed to
        admit that it took me a long time to realize the Find button and
        <code>Ctrl+F</code> were there.)  I believe this is only
        available in Vista/2008 and up.
      </p>
      <img src="images/eventLogFindButton.png" width="776" height="311"
           alt="Screenshot of Windows 2008(R2?) Server Manager showing
                the Event Log Find button.  Specifically, the left pane
                of Server Manager is open to tree node Server Manager,
                Diagnostics, Event Viewer, Windows Logs, System.
                Events are listed in the middle pane.  Actions
                are shown in the right pane, and in category System,
                the Find button is circled.">
      <p>
        Note: This even finds text strings that only exist in the
        combination of the format string and message parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: The GUI Event Viewer filter's "User" field will not find
        Logon events by username.
      </p>

      <h4>Turning off Filtering - Cautionary Note</h4>
      <p>
        If you do Filtering in the Event Viewer GUI, and then turn the
        Filtering back off, just be a little careful.  
      </p>
      <img src="images/eventLogClearFilter.png" width="776" height="293"
           alt="Screenshot of Windows 2008(R2?) Server Manager showing
                the System Event Log, with the Clear Log and Clear Filter 
                actions circled in the right pane, showing how close
                they are to each other.">
      <p>
        Notice how close together those two options on the right side
        are.  "Clear Filter" to see the entire log again, versus "Clear
        Log..." to lose the entire log forever...slight difference
        there.  (I live in fear of someday choosing the wrong one...I
        may be a sad, sad person.)
      </p>

      <h3>Powershell Event Log Cmdlets</h3>
      <p>
        Powershell has two cmdlets for retrieving Windows event logs,
        <code>Get-EventLog</code> and <code>Get-WinEvent</code>.  The
        latter is new with Windows Vista/2008.
      </p>

      <h4>Get-EventLog</h4>
      <p>Pros:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is the only cmdlet available on Windows XP/2003?  (And on
          newer versions of Windows, it is the only cmdlet that can read
          ''remote'' event logs from Windows XP/2003 computers?)
        </li>
        <li>
          It provides a convenient <code>-Message</code> parameter for
          easily searching message contents.  It is the only cmdlet that
          efficiently lets you combine this message text search with a
          parameter (<code>-Newest</code>) which can efficiently limit the
          results to the most recent few events?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It cannot return events from all Windows Vista/2008 and newer
          event logs.  It can only return events from the "Classic"
          event logs (which I believe are the event logs like
          Application, Security, Setup, and System, not the new ones
          under Applications and Services Logs.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Get-WinEvent</h4>
      <p>
        The pros and cons of <code>Get-WinEvent</code> are the converse
        of those for <code>Get-EventLog</code>.
      </p>

      <h4>Filtering Event Logs By Message Description in Powershell</h4>
      <p>
        Powershell's two Windows event log cmdlets differ in their
        filtering behavior, but both have useful options.  Make use of
        <code>Get-WinEvent's -MaxEvents</code> parameter and
        <code>Get-EventLog's -Newest</code> parameter when testing
        filters.  They always seem to filter quickly, and reduce output
        when testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tip: The following <strong>might</strong> find recent logons for
        a user named Lethargo, although you might need UAC elevation to
        access the Security event log:
      </p>

      <code><kbd>Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable
                 @{ LogName="Security"; ID=4624; Data="Lethargo" }
                 -MaxEvents 10</kbd></code>

      <h3>Miscellaneous Event Log Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When reading through Logon event messages, don't stop at the
          "Subject" user...keep reading further down the message.
        </li>
        <li>
          With <code>Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable</code>, you can use
          <code>Data="service name"</code>, but I haven't found a way to
          search on a whole message description (formatted or
          unformatted?).
        </li>
        <li>
          The wevtutil command can also list event log messages.<br>
          <code><kbd> wevtutil gp "Service Control Manager" /ge /gm</kbd></code>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Windows Event Log XPATH Filtering Tip</h4>
      <p>
        This query seemed to give only Svc Ctrl Mgr info events (&amp;
        verbose?), including starting, stopping, and changing from
        demand to auto start (7040)...
      </p>
      <pre><code>
&lt;QueryList&gt;
  &lt;Query Id="0" Path="System"&gt;
    &lt;Select Path="System"&gt;
        *[System[Provider[@Name='Service Control Manager']
                 and (Level=4 or Level=0 or Level=5)
                ]
          and
          EventData[Data[@Name='param1']='Windows Time']
         ]
    &lt;/Select&gt;
  &lt;/Query&gt;
&lt;/QueryList&gt;
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        This query should be its inverse, and it appears to be in
        initial testing.  Compared to the previous query, note the
        additional Select * line, and the replacement of Select from the
        previous query with Suppress.  It seems to give System event
        log, minus informational (&amp; verbose?) Service Control
        Manager messages about the Windows Time service.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
&lt;QueryList&gt;
  &lt;Query Id="0" Path="System"&gt;
    <strong>&lt;Select Path="System"&gt;*&lt;/Select&gt;</strong>
    &lt;<strong>Suppress</strong> Path="System"&gt;
        *[System[Provider[@Name='Service Control Manager']
                 and (Level=4 or Level=0 or Level=5) ]
          and
          EventData[Data[@Name='param1']='Windows Time']
         ]
    &lt;/Suppress&gt;
  &lt;/Query&gt;
&lt;/QueryList&gt;

      <h2>Insanity, or<br>
          What I Learned from Configuring ODBC on Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
      <p>
        Prose may not be the best way to explain the technical aspects
        of configuring ODBC drivers on 64-bit Windows 7.  However, it
        probably <em>is</em> the best way to emphasize the pathos.
      </p>
      <h3>32-bit Windows</h3>
      <p>
        Most of Windows consists of Dynamic Link Libraries, or DLLs.  These
        are files containing executable computer code that do not run by
        themselves, but instead load into memory space of one or more
        executable programs, or EXEs.  When Microsoft Windows went from
        16-bit to 32-bit, they decided to put the 32-bit DLLs and executables
        in the appropriately-named C:\Windows\System32\ directory.
        The 32-bit ODBC control panel was one such executable,
        and it was appropriately named odbcad32.exe.
        There  was also a system called Windows On Windows, or WOW, which let
        old 16-bit applications run on 32-bit Windows.  (I am not sure what
        directory WOW's supporting files lived in, but it doesn't matter
        to this discussion.)
      </p>
      <h3>64-bit Windows</h3>
      <p>
        Fast forward a decade or two, and Windows goes from 32-bit to 64-bit.
        Evidently enough people hard-coded the directory name
        C:\Windows\System32\ into their programs and scripts that Microsoft
        decided they could not change the name.  Therefore, instead of
        C:\Windows\System64\, the Windows 64-bit DLLs and executables
        go in C:\Windows\System32\.
        The 64-bit ODBC control panel is one such executable.  However,
        again people were too used to the name odbcad32.exe,
        so the 64-bit ODBC control panel became
        C:\Windows\System32\odbcad32.exe.
        Just like WOW let 16-bit applications run on 32-bit Windows,
        Microsoft created Windows on Windows 64, or WOW64, to let
        32-bit applications run on 64-bit Windows.
        And here we have our first incongruity.  In 64-bit Windows,
        while 64-bit Windows DLLs and executables go in C:\Windows\System32\,
        the 32-bit Windows DLLs and executables go in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\.
        To make the transition seamless for 32-bit applications,
        when a 32-bit application asks 64-bit Windows for something from
        C:\Windows\System32\, WOW64 behind the scenes redirects that to
        C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ behind the scenes, so that 32-bit programs
        get the 32-bit DLLs they need.
      </p>
      <h3>ODBC Control Panel</h3>
      <p>
        Because ODBC drivers are just DLLs that load into the memory
        space of the executable that loads them, a 64-bit application
        needs to use a 64-bit ODBC driver, but a 32-bit application still
        needs to use a 32-bit ODBC driver.  Windows 64-bit still has
        a 32-bit ODBC Control Panel to manage those, which is
        C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe.
        Notice that it is the number of bits the application runs as
        that determines which ODBC drivers and ODBC Control Panel you
        use to manage them.  If you have a 32-bit version of Microsoft
        Excel running on a 64-bit version of Windows, and you want
        to access a database, you need a 32-bit ODBC driver that
        matches the application, not a 64-bit ODBC driver that matches
        the operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        After installing your 32-bit ODBC driver, however, you cannot
        run Window 64-bit's default 64-bit ODBC Control Panel.  If you do,
        it won't see your 32-bit ODBC driver.  You open a web browser
        and search online, and find out that you have to open the
        32-bit ODBC Control Panel, at C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe.
        However, there is a final injury added to the insult.  On Windows 7,
        if you leave the 64-bit ODBC Control Panel up in the background
        behind your web browser, and you try to run the
        32-bit ODBC Control Panel, then instead of running
        the 32-bit ODBC Control Panel, Windows just brings the already-running
        copy of the 64-bit ODBC Control Panel to the top, still without
        your 32-bit ODBC driver showing...Oh, and the window title bars?
        They are exactly the same, with nothing to indicate that you
        got the wrong ODBC Control Panel (aside from what drivers, etc.
        are listed.)
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        So, if you have a 32-bit application running 64-bit Windows 7,
        and you need to access something via ODBC, the steps you
        need to take are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Install the 32-bit ODBC driver</li>
        <li>Look through your open windows, and close any running copy of
            the ODBC Control Panel</li>
        <li>Run the 32-bit ODBC Control Panel from
            C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You should then see your 32-bit ODBC driver in the Drivers tab.</p>
