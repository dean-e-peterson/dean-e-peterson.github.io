      <h2>Dean's Paper Airplane</h2>
      <!--  Note: images are SVG files, so not pre-scaling them should not
            affect download times. -->
      <p>
        I designed my own paper airplane.  It is not the best paper
        airplane, but it does fly.  The airplane is made with a square
        piece of paper.  Its axis of symmetry is along the diagonal,
        which is somewhat unusual.
      </p>
      <!-- TODO: Address accessibility with description of diagrams?
      <p class="sr-only">
        There are diagrams for each step showing the completed
        folds as described by the text.
      </p>
      -->
      <ol>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane01.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Fold a square sheet of paper in half both horizontally
            and vertically.  (These folds just guide folding the airplane
            in thirds along the diagonal in a later step.)
            Unfold and fold the sheet in half along one diagonal.
            This will be the main axis of symmetry.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane02.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Fold the top-right corner down to vertical crease.
            The fold should reach all the way to the top-left corner.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane03.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Fold the bottom-left corner up like the previous step.
            This should form a flattened cone spreading out from
            the upper-left corner.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane04.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Turn the paper over.  Fold the upper-left point down
            to the middle of the sheet of paper, where the horizontal
            and vertical creases cross.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane05.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Turn the paper over to the original side.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane06.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Fold the flap on the top layer of the cone down.
            The fold should extend from the highest point
            on the upper-left, to the end of the previous fold
            on the lower-right.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane07.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Temporarily unfold the previous fold.
            Temporarily unfold the point of the cone back out
            from where it was folded underneath.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane08.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Unfold the entire flap of the cone down.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane09.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Fold the other flap of the cone up as shown,
            from where the crease of the point that was previously
            folded under meets the edge of the paper on the left,
            over to where the flap meets the bottom layer of the
            cone on the right.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane10.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            No new folds.  This step just shows what the sheet of
            paper would look like now if you unfolded all existing folds.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane11.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Unfold the last fold.
            On the top flap, which is also the top layer,
            fold the bottom edge of the flap up to the crease
            from the previous fold.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane12.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Repeat the same fold for the other side,
            on the cone flap that is below the diagonal.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane13.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Refold the cone flaps above and below the diagonal
            as shown.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane14.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            <strong>Here is the tricky step.</strong>
            Fold the point at the upper-left <strong>into</strong>
            the cone.  When complete it should appear as shown.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane15.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Refold the paper along the original diagonal.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane16.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Fold the plane in half.  Turn it so the original diagonal
            is at the bottom.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane17.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Fold the wing on the top layer down from the top
            corner at left, such that on the lower right
            the prior crease reaches just to the bottom of the plane.
            This wing fold will be close to, but not exactly,
            parallel to the bottom of the plane.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/dpplane18.svg" alt="">
          <p>
            Turn the plane over.
            Fold down the wing on the other side.
            Lift both wings up so that they stick out from the keel.
            The airplane is ready to fly.
