      <h2 id="howWebWorks">How the Web Works</h2>
      <p>
        The World Wide Web is a decentralized system for storing, referencing,
        and retrieving information.  The term Internet is often used
        colloquially as a synonym for the World Wide Web, but at a technical
        level they are separate.  The internet is the global network of
        computers which provides the connections that the web uses to
        retrieve information.
      </p>
      <h3>Storing Information</h3>
      <p>
        The data accessible via the World Wide Web is stored on web servers
        all over the world.  These are computers whose purpose is to store
        web pages and other files, and to pass them over the network upon
        request.  Anyone can run their own web server, although they may
        have to pay an internet service provider or telecommunications
        company to provide the connection to the rest of the internet.
        Most individuals and small companies rent space on a web hosting
        company's web servers for a fee.
      </p>
      <h3>Referencing Information</h3>
      <p>
        The web's native form of content is the web page, a text document with
        special markup (HTML) indicating document structure and containing
        hyperlinks, which are links to any other document on the Web.
        The simplicity and ubiquity of hyperlinks has profound implications,
        allowing any document  to reference any other (public) document
        in the world, creating the "web" of references that gives the
        World Wide Web its name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web pages are displayed by computer programs called web browsers.
        These are the windows to the web which run on computers, smartphones,
        etc. that people look at to view the web.  Browsers format the
        web pages for viewing, and allow the user to select the hyperlinks
        to navigate between documents on the web.
      </p>
      <h3>Retrieving Information</h3>
      <p>
        When a user enters a web address or clicks on a hyperlink,
        behind the scenes, the web browser uses the global DNS database
        to convert the web server's domain name into a numeric IP address.
        Then, the browser talks to the web server over the internet to
        request the desired document.  The request is formatted in a specific
        way, per the HTTP protocol.  Upon receiving the request, the web server
        sends the requested web page back over the internet to the browser that
        requested it.

      <h2 id="cssMusings">CSS Specification Musings</h2>
      <p>
        I wonder if <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
        specification clarity and organization is a casualty of the tension
        between the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> and browser
        implementers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/">CSS 2</a> revision
        has a red note saying that &ldquo;several sections ... have been
        updated by other specifications&rdquo;, and points you to a
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css">portion of a document</a>
        that has indexes into those specifications.
        In other words, there is no single official CSS 3 specification
        document, as I understand it.  I'm sure I don't know the challenges
        they face trying to standardize a moving target, but it does seem a
        bit unfortunate.

      <h2 id="decentral">The Decentralized Nature of the Web</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="leadIn">The decentralized nature of the World Wide Web is
        a key strength</span> on both technological and social levels.
        Technologically, it makes it harder to destroy any significant
        proportion of the internet.  Socially, the World Wide Web represents
        the greatest leap in the publication and availability of information
        since the printing press.
      </p>
      <p>
        The web's decentralized nature does have some drawbacks, as criminals
        or other bad actors can more easily sell illicit goods from hiding.
        Also, there is no common provision of backup and continued access to
        information in the event of a catastrophe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decentralization of the web is somewhat limited by the prevalence
        of large telecommunications companies providing the backbone network
        links that carry much of the traffic, and by the influence of search
        engines, especially Google, as the way most people find content on
        the web in the first place.
