      <h2>Disability and Accessibility Contents</h2>
      <p>
        When people think about web accessibility, they often focus on
        people who have difficulty seeing or hearing the content.
        While these are completely valid concerns, people with
        other conditions can also face challenges using web content:

      <h2>Autism and Accessibility</h2>
      <h3>Autism Description</h3>
      <p>
        Autism is a spectrum of related conditions which cause problems
        with social skills, repetitive behaviors, issues with speech and
        communication, etc. (from 
        <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism">What is Autism</a>,
        by Autism Speaks).
      </p>
      <h3>Autism Web Accessibility Tips</h3>
      <p>
        Web developers can help users with autism by doing the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a clear, uncluttered site.</li>
        <li>
          Avoid things that distract people.  Specifically...
          <ul>
            <li>Avoid animation and movement, or have a way to stop them</li>
            <li>Avoid background music and sounds</li>
            <li>Do not use a lot of bright primary colors</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make your site navigation act consistently</li>
        <li>Use clear, plain, <em>literal</em> language</li>
        <li>Avoid metaphors, figures of speech, and any language
            that is figurative or can have more than one meaning</li>
        <li>Use bullet lists instead of a wall of text</li>
        <li>Provide visual alternatives to text information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The suggestions above may help all users, but they are especially
        important for users with autism.
      </p>
      <h3>Autism Accommodations</h3>
      <p>
        I did not see very many products to help people with autism use the web.
        One user found Site-Specific Browsers (SSBs) useful
        (<a href="http://www.iheni.com/an-interview-with-jamie-knight-autism-and-accessible-web-design/">Jamie Knight interview</a>).
        These make a specific web page act like an application, without
        the full web browser user interface, which can simplify the experience.
        An example is a Mac application called
        <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a>.
        Apps from the Apple, Google, and Windows app stores that target a
        specific web platform (like Facebook) may have similar benefits,
        at least when compared with accessing those same platforms
        using a normal web browser.
      </p>
      <h3>Autism Accessibility Resources</h3>
      <p>
        A simple Google search gives useful results,
        but here are some references I found helpful:
      </p>
      <ul>

    <section id="tremors">
      <h2>Hand Tremors and Accessibility</h2>
      <h3>Tremor Description</h3>
      <p>
        Hand tremors are an unintentional, continual shaking of the hands.
        They can grow worse as we age.  They are sometimes the result of
        Parkinson's disease or a stroke.
        Tremors can make it difficult to use a mouse, a touch screen,
        or even a keyboard.
      </p>
      <h3>Tremor Web Accessibility Tips</h3>
      <p>
        Web developers can help users with tremors by doing the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make clickable areas like links large.</li>
        <li>Avoid tiny font sizes.</li>
        <li>
          Make sure your site reacts well to being zoomed in.
          (Some users with tremors and or eye problems may zoom their
          web browser in to help handle those issues.  However,
          if your site does not zoom well, the user might have to
          scroll horizontally, negating some of the benefit.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tremor Accommodations</h3>
      <p>
        People with hand tremors may want to consider the following
        accommodations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Operating System accessibility settings such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Filter Keys</li>
            <li>Sticky Keys</li>
            <li>Mouse speed settings</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Products such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Voice recognition software</li>
            <li>Specialty Computer Mice</li>
            <li>
              Keyguards - They go over the keyboard.  The user rests their
              hands on the keyguard, which has holes in it that the user
              can type through with fewer accidental keystrokes due to tremors.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <span class="leadIn">P.O.U.R. is an accessibility mnemonic standing
        for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.</span>
        It is also the organizing principal of the
        <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C's</abbr>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">
          WCAG 2.0 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
        </a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Perceivable</h3>
      <p>
        All web users should be able to perceive all of the content
        on the website.  The content should be available to multiple
        senses so that those with visual or hearing impairments can
        still perceive it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site tries to be perceivable by providing alternate text
        for images, by including "skip navigation" and "to top" links,
        and by providing page structure with semantic markup and
        descriptive heading elements.
      </p>
      <h3>Operable</h3>
      <p>
        All web users should be able to operate the user interface
        of the website.  This includes, but is not limited to,
        navigation links, search functionality, and forms.
        Anything the user interacts with should be usable
        by all users, even those who have difficulty seeing
        or using a mouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site tries to be operable by using hyperlinks that
        describe the target without outside context and by labeling
        all form fields.  Navigation menu links are rather large,
        and are also accessible in logical order via the keyboard.
      </p>
      <h3>Understandable</h3>
      <p>
        Making a web site understandable to all users involves a few
        things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use simple language if possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't surprise the user, especially with unexpected
          behaviors in places other than where the user is focusing.
          Keep the context around what the user is doing consistent,
          beginning with consistent navigation and behavior.
          As another example, users of screen readers may not see a change
          you make elsewhere on the page, so only change the state
          of the whole page when you tell the user that is what you
          are going to do, like with a submit button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use semantic markup to help assistive technologies
          help the user.  For example, specifying the language
          that a page is written in, or specifying the language
          of a quotation in a different language, will help a
          screen reader to pronounce the content appropriately,
          instead of confusingly.  Other markup such as the
          abbreviation tag can help, too.
      </ul>
      <p>
        This site tries to be understandable by specifying the
        language with the &lt;html&gt; tag lang attribute, by
        including full versions of appropriate abbreviations
        with the &lt;abbr&gt; tag, by not changing the context
        or layout of the site or page except for an user-initiated
        form submission, and by the use of bullet lists where a
        list of items may be simpler to understand than prose.
      </p>
      <h3>Robust</h3>
      <p>
        The website should be well-designed using web standards
        and best practices.  The website should use valid HTML.
        This helps make the website accessible from both
        today's technology (some of which you may not have available
        to test) and tomorrow's technology as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site tries to be robust by using standard, validated
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, by
        attempting to follow best practices in the use of semantic
        markup and accessibility tools like alternative text,
        and by at least rudimentary testing on multiple browsers.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        These are my interpretations of P.O.U.R.
