      <h2>Calling Asynchronous Code from Synchronous Code in C#</h2>
      <p>
        First a major caveat.  If possible, avoid doing this at all.  See
        <a href="https://github.com/davidfowl/AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios/blob/master/AsyncGuidance.md"
        target="_blank">David Fowler's Asynchronous .NET Advice</a>
        for advice on both what to avoid and why.
        Just make things asynchronous all the way up your call chain.
        However, if you do need to call asynchronous code from
        synchronous code in C#, buckle up and read on.
      </p>
      <h3>The Difficulty</h3>
      <p>
        As I understand it, if an <code>async</code> C# method cannot complete
        immediately, it turns over control until it finishes.  When it
        finishes, it tries to continue in something called a synchronization
        context.  This may be a thread pool, a message loop, or possibly
        something else, depending on whether the app is a console app, a
        Windows app, or a web app.  If you called the <code>async</code>
        method with <code>await</code>, the rest of the calling method
        continues at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you cannot use <code>await</code> except in a method that is
        itself declared as <code>async</code>, forcing it to be turtles, uh,
        async, all the way down, no, up.  You can get around this by calling
        the <code>async</code> method from a non-<code>async</code> method,
        then calling something like <code>Task.Result</code> on the returned
        <code>Task</code> object.  <em>(TODO: Here or elsewhere add Wait and
        the other ways to do this.)</em>
        However, this can block the calling thread.  Remember, that for the
        <code>async</code> method to finish and return, it has to come back
        to the synchronization context that called it.  If you are blocking
        it, you get a deadlock, where the code can hang forever with
        <code>Task.Result</code> blocking waiting for the <code>async</code>
        method to return, and the <code>async</code> method waiting for the
        synchronization context that <code>Task.Result</code> is blocking to
        become available so that it <strong>can</strong> return.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be able to get around the deadlock by
        <em>TODO: Add the method call that gets around this</em>.
        However, that gets around it by allowing the <code>async</code>
        method to return to a separate synchronization context, one that
        is not blocked.  Undesireable effects of this may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Occupying another thread in a thread pool increasing the
            resource use of a web app trying to conserve on threads.
          </p>  
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Running on another thread that no longer has access to
            the user interface if it is a Windows app.
            <em>TODO: Test this, and see if it affects the following
            code in the calling method.</em>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>TODO: Figure out what to do and add that as well as
        example code.</em>
