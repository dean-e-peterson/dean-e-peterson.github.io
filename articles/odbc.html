      <h2>Insanity, or<br>
          What I Learned from Configuring ODBC on Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
      <p>
        Prose may not be the best way to explain the technical aspects
        of configuring ODBC drivers on 64-bit Windows 7.  However, it
        probably <em>is</em> the best way to emphasize the pathos.
      </p>
      <h3>32-bit Windows</h3>
      <p>
        Most of Windows consists of Dynamic Link Libraries, or DLLs.  These
        are files containing executable computer code that do not run by
        themselves, but instead load into memory space of one or more
        executable programs, or EXEs.  When Microsoft Windows went from
        16-bit to 32-bit, they decided to put the 32-bit DLLs and executables
        in the appropriately-named C:\Windows\System32\ directory.
        The 32-bit ODBC control panel was one such executable,
        and it was appropriately named odbcad32.exe.
        There  was also a system called Windows On Windows, or WOW, which let
        old 16-bit applications run on 32-bit Windows.  (I am not sure what
        directory WOW's supporting files lived in, but it doesn't matter
        to this discussion.)
      </p>
      <h3>64-bit Windows</h3>
      <p>
        Fast forward a decade or two, and Windows goes from 32-bit to 64-bit.
        Evidently enough people hard-coded the directory name
        C:\Windows\System32\ into their programs and scripts that Microsoft
        decided they could not change the name.  Therefore, instead of
        C:\Windows\System64\, the Windows 64-bit DLLs and executables
        go in C:\Windows\System32\.
        The 64-bit ODBC control panel is one such executable.  However,
        again people were too used to the name odbcad32.exe,
        so the 64-bit ODBC control panel became
        C:\Windows\System32\odbcad32.exe.
        Just like WOW let 16-bit applications run on 32-bit Windows,
        Microsoft created Windows on Windows 64, or WOW64, to let
        32-bit applications run on 64-bit Windows.
        And here we have our first incongruity.  In 64-bit Windows,
        while 64-bit Windows DLLs and executables go in C:\Windows\System32\,
        the 32-bit Windows DLLs and executables go in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\.
        To make the transition seamless for 32-bit applications,
        when a 32-bit application asks 64-bit Windows for something from
        C:\Windows\System32\, WOW64 redirects that to
        C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ behind the scenes, so that 32-bit programs
        get the 32-bit DLLs they need.
      </p>
      <h3>ODBC Control Panel</h3>
      <p>
        Because ODBC drivers are just DLLs that load into the memory
        space of the executable that loads them, a 64-bit application
        needs to use a 64-bit ODBC driver, but a 32-bit application still
        needs to use a 32-bit ODBC driver.  Windows 64-bit still has
        a 32-bit ODBC Control Panel to manage those, which is
        C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe.
        Notice that it is the number of bits the application runs as
        that determines which ODBC drivers and ODBC Control Panel you
        use to manage them.  If you have a 32-bit version of Microsoft
        Excel running on a 64-bit version of Windows, and you want
        to access a database, you need a 32-bit ODBC driver that
        matches the application, not a 64-bit ODBC driver that matches
        the operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        After installing your 32-bit ODBC driver, however, you cannot
        run Window 64-bit's default 64-bit ODBC Control Panel.  If you do,
        it won't see your 32-bit ODBC driver.  You open a web browser
        and search online, and find out that you have to open the
        32-bit ODBC Control Panel, at C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe.
        However, there is a final injury added to the insult.  On Windows 7,
        if you leave the 64-bit ODBC Control Panel up in the background
        behind your web browser, and you try to run the
        32-bit ODBC Control Panel, then instead of running
        the 32-bit ODBC Control Panel, Windows just brings the already-running
        copy of the 64-bit ODBC Control Panel to the top, still without
        your 32-bit ODBC driver showing...Oh, and the window title bars?
        They are exactly the same, with nothing to indicate that you
        got the wrong ODBC Control Panel (aside from what drivers, etc.
        are listed.)
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        So, if you have a 32-bit application running 64-bit Windows 7,
        and you need to access something via ODBC, the steps you
        need to take are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Install the 32-bit ODBC driver</li>
        <li>Look through your open windows, and close any running copy of
            the ODBC Control Panel</li>
        <li>Run the 32-bit ODBC Control Panel from
            C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You should then see your 32-bit ODBC driver in the Drivers tab.</p>
