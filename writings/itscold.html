      <h2>It's Cold</h2>
      <br />
      <p>I trudge through the door with some dread in my heart.  It's cold.</p>
      <p>Knowing the sounds I won't hear anymore.  It's cold.</p>
      <p>Your presence, your warmth, irritations are gone.</p>
      <p>This place that I live in don't seem like a home.</p>
      <p>Tender moments, mundane, that mean more 'cause their common.</p>
      <p>The places seem empty, those places that saw them.</p>
      <p>I'm pretty ok, but malaise draws me in, 'cause it's cold.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Distractions I try, they don't work all that long.  It's cold.</p>
      <p>My interests I ply, I may listen to songs, but it's cold.</p>
      <p>Thoughts are elsewhere, relief!  But I've come to expect</p>
      <p>interruptions and so then I look to my left</p>
      <p>expecting annoyance--instead, I'm bereft.  It's cold.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I sit in the love seat that used to hold two.  It's cold.</p>
      <p>I place my hand down on the warm spot you found, but it's cold.</p>
      <p>I shed a few tears, wipe my eyes, blow my nose.</p>
      <p>I'll live, I'll move on, I know that's how it goes.</p>
      <p>Yet your absence surprises each time that I notice, it's cold.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Where my heart warmed for you, brought a touch or a smile, it is cold.</p>
      <p>Even where I wished for a free moment or two, now it's cold.</p>
      <p>Yet your memories are here, and the warmth that you brought,</p>
      <p>for so long and so clear, it was not all for naught.</p>
      <p>It lingers, just not at the front of my thoughts, so it's cold.</p>
      <br />
      <p>This hurt, it will heal, and most sadness will pass, this I know.</p>
      <p>That time is not here, I will mourn for you now.  It is cold.</p>
      <p>You deserve nothing less than this hurt that I feel.</p>
      <p>What you've given to me is what this pain reveals.</p>
      <p>Love that's new, your warm memories, someday'll overpower</p>
      <p>the grief in which now this sad child sit and cowers</p>
      <p>no tantrum will speed up these days and these hours.</p>
      <p>'Til then, know I love you, I'll treasure you still through the cold.</p>
      <br />
